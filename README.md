# NewMonopoly 

**NewMonopoly** is a  full-stack application that recreates and digitizes the classic board game logic of *Monopoly*. The project was developed as a university assignment for the Software Engineering course.

##  Technologies and Architecture

The project was developed by applying architectural and behavioral patterns to ensure modularity, testability and scalability:

* **Event-Driven Architecture & WebSockets:** Real-time communication handled through asynchronous sockets for responsive game events.
* **Dispatcher Pattern (`WebSocketConnectorDispatcher`):** Centralized message routing logic to decouple dispatching from processing.
* **Service & Repository Pattern:** Clear separation between business logic and data persistence (PostgreSQL).
* **Manager/Handler Pattern (`TurnManager`, `GameHandler`):** Component-based design with isolated responsibilities for managing turns and matches.
* **Singleton (`GameBoardSingleton`):** Game state managed in a single shared and synchronized instance.
* **Observer Pattern (Frontend):** Reactive synchronization of the UI state in React using lifecycle hooks (`useEffect`).
* **SOLID Principles (SRP and OCP):** Single-responsibility classes and high system extensibility without modifying existing source code.

## Main Features

* **Board and Turn Management:** Full simulation of the game board, dice and token movement.
* **Economic System:** Buying and selling properties, managing houses/hotels, mortgages and bank transactions.
* **Chance and Community Chest Cards:** Dynamic handling of random events during the match.
* **Game Logic & Rules:** Automatic checking of bankruptcy conditions, jail and the final winner.

## Work Methodology and CI/CD

* **Project Management (Agile/Waterfall):** The workflow was planned and tracked using a **Gantt Chart** to break down milestones, manage dependencies and assign tasks between Frontend and Backend.
* **Continuous Integration & Deployment (CI/CD):** Use of **GitHub Actions** (`.github/`) to automate build, testing and release rollback processes.
